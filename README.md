# bike-wheel-fem
Finite-element stress analysis for bicycle wheel implemented in Python and NumPy

bike-wheel-fem is a Python module for calculating the stresses and strains in a
wire (thin-spoked) wheel. I am making every effort to make the code usable and
self- explanatory to bike enthusiasts and mechanics, regardless of background in
stress analysis or numerical methods.

## Requirements

* Python 2.7.x or later [(www.python.org)](www.python.org)
* NumPy [(www.numpy.org)](www.numpy.org)
* SciPy [(www.scipy.org)](www.scipy.org)
* matplotlib [(www.matplotlib.org)](www.matplotlib.org) - required for plotting and visualization

All of these packages and more are included in the popular [Anaconda distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/). 

## Installation

Download all the files into one directory. You can put the module bike-wheel-
fem.py anywhere on your module path, or keep it in the same directory as where
you write python scripts.
